## Innovative Idea
Most applications for music production are geared towards meticulous composition/studio recording, which are powerful in their capability but boring to use/watch in a live setting. Our project will be designed for live music programming (not the coding type of programming, [this kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_(music)).
## Important Components
Our project aims to create 1. A simple web application that allows users of any musical experience to compose short loops on the fly and 2. A forum that allows users to share their music projects with one another. The composition aspect of the website will include a loop over a sequence of notes, each with customizable attributes such as sample type, volume, pitch, delay, etc. This simple framework could allow the user to make drum loops, melodies, and harmonies. The forum aspect of the website will allow users to browse and rate and comment on other people's uploads. It will also allow users to load other people's uploads into their loop editor, so any sort of changes can be made to an existing project, allowing for a musical community that directly builds off of each other's ideas.
